## list with ideas

### A.Morphing
Goal: implement shape morphing with D3  
Examples & Tutorials: 
- http://jamiepopkin.blogspot.ca/2015/05/morphing-between-svg-shapes.html

* **A1.Simple shape morphing**
   	- learn how morphing works by morphing simple geometrical shapes...or other shapes
	- idea for extra-task: build some funny, eye-catching, repetitive visualization of shape morphing

* **A2.Geo-morphing** 
	- morph shapes of countries to other countries
	- idea for extra-task: create a quiz in which users would have to guess what country it is

* **A3.Projections morphing**
	- is it possible to manually distort projections by interactively 'grabbing' single gridlines and dragging them around? I imagine the result like in the images...

### Flows
Goal: play with possibilities to visualize movement  
Examples & Tutorials:

* **B1.Animate stroke from start to end to show moving direction**
	Created something like this: http://raluca-nicola.net/travelMap/ 
	Could be improved: move on a given path (for example a road)
